# Fails if a setting that decides what a Vercel deployment installs or publishes has
# changed. The deploy check runs this before it builds anything.
#
# Vercel's function build ignores installCommand, so .npmrc is what keeps package
# install scripts away from the project's environment variables. npm uses the last
# value in the file, and reads other settings there too, such as the registry, so the
# whole file has to match. Its own answer is then checked as well, since it is what the
# install will do.
#
# A package.json in a subdirectory makes the install run from there, with its own
# scripts and dependencies, and another lockfile takes over from package-lock.json or
# picks another package manager. Either would step around these checks and the checks
# on the lockfile in scripts/check-lockfile.ts (npm run lint:lockfile).
#
# Vercel does run a buildCommand from vercel.json, which could turn install scripts back
# on or run anything else with the project's variables. The project builds without one,
# so vercel.json may not set any command.
#
# Previews hold no secrets, but only main and staging are meant to deploy at all.
