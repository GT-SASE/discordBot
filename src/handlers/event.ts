/**
 * /event: the commands that create, attach and look after an event's forum post.
 * What officers can read, and what happens to a post, are decided in docs/adr/0007.
 *
 * A guild and an actor only ever come from the signed payload, and an option is read
 * by name, so extra options change nothing. Everything that changes state claims the
 * interaction first, which is why a replayed create makes one row and one post.
 *
 * Creating an event is a row, then a post, then a write joining them, and Discord or
 * the database can fail between any two:
 *
 * - No post was made: the row stays `pending`. The same /event create takes it up.
 * - Discord did not confirm the post: the post may exist. It is looked for among the
 *   bot's own posts in that forum, now and on any retry, so a retry adopts it rather
 *   than making another. Only a post made since the row and held by no live event can
 *   be it, and if two could be, none is chosen. A person decides.
 * - Two retries at once: each takes the row's post attempt first, which one holds for
 *   60 seconds, and the other is told it is in progress. A clear refusal gives it back.
 * - The post exists but could not be saved: the reply names the post, the log holds
 *   both IDs, and /event link inside it, or the same /event create, attaches it.
 *
 * A post can also be deleted after all this, which marks the row `missing` and stops its
 * reminders. The tasks are on that row and cannot be moved, so nothing here makes a
 * second event beside it: /event link in a replacement post, or the same /event create,
 * gives the row a post again and its tasks and reminders carry on. /event link matches on
 * the post's title and the date, or takes the event it is told to, whatever the title.
 *
 * An event picker offers choices from autocomplete, but any value can be submitted, so
 * a submitted value only ever names a row to load by ID and signed guild. A deleted
 * event, another guild's event and a value that is no ID all get the one refusal.
