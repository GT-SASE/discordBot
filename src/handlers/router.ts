/**
 * Turns a verified interaction into a reply. To add a command, write one file in
 * this directory that exports `handler`, and add one line to modules.ts.
 *
 * Nothing runs unless a route was found by exact match in a Map, so `constructor`
 * and `__proto__` find nothing, and its gate ran `authorize`, `holdsTierFor` or
 * `autocompleteScope` with an actor parsed from this interaction's own signed payload. Nothing in a
 * custom_id grants anything: it names a route and carries validated IDs and a
 * version, and each one is checked again by the handler that uses it.
 *
 * Discord allows 3 seconds for the first reply, so the router makes one read of at
 * most 1.5 seconds before answering, which leaves time for the fixed reply if it
 * fails. Anything slower goes in `finish`: the reply is a private acknowledgement,
 * and the work runs after it on a client with a longer deadline, with a
 * state-changing route first claiming the interaction so that a replayed request
 * changes nothing. The content of that work goes back through Discord with the
 * interaction's token, so a replayer of the HTTP request does not receive it.
 *
 * Autocomplete is the exception: Discord takes its choices only in the HTTP response,
 * so it cannot be deferred, and nothing claims it. Replaying a captured signed request
 * inside the signature window gets the choices, read fresh, in the response.
 *
 * Do not log anything from the payload: only the action and an error's type.
