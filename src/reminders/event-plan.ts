 * Plans the event workflow reminders: the daily list of an event's unfinished steps, and

 *
 * Unlike task reminders, nothing here goes out late. A day's list is only worth sending on
 * that day, and a pickup reminder only on its own day, so a reminder whose day has passed
 * is never sent. A claim on one that was left by a crashed run is closed as skipped.
